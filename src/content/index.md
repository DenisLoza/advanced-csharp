Welcome to the Advanced Programming with C# course! The course begins 1.11.2021 and ends 19.12.2021. 

This is the second part of the two part course. You can find the first part, Basics of Programming with C#, from here: [https://centria.github.io/basic-csharp/](https://centria.github.io/basic-csharp/).

<Note>This course has a living material, which means it will be published on weekly basis. This includes both the materials and the exercises.</Note>

## If you just want to learn

To attend the course, you do not have to be a student in Centria University of Applied science. All the material and exercises are available online. If you want to get ECTS credits for the course, you have to register to Centria Open University.


## Registering to Open University course

<Note>The open version will be published in January!</Note>

You can register to the course from [TBD](https://tki.centria.fi/koulutus/). This version of the course is open until 1.5.2022 and has only one final deadline at 1.5.2022.


## Learning goals and grading


The list below does not include everything, but exists to give a guideline for students, what to expect each week. This list may extend as the course goes on.


| Part     |      Goal   |  
|:--------:|------------|
| 7| You can create a project with proper structure and are able to run tests in the correct folder. |
| 8| You can use **dictionaries** as data storage, understand **hash** and solve problems with them in object oriented programming. |
| 9| You understand inheritance and interfaces. You will learn to create classes that inherit another classes, and also classes that implement one or more interfaces. |
| 10| You understand how objects are compared and can use this information. You understand the basics of enumeration and regular expressions. |
| 11| You can create random strings and numbers. You are able to handle exceptions, read and write (to and from) files, and use these in problem solving. |
| 12| You understand the basics of the keyword **using**. You can create small graphical interfaces for your programs. |


The course is graded on a scale of 0-5. The grade comprises of the amount of exercises done.

| Percentage done | Grade |
| :-------------- | :---: |
| 90 % or more    |   5   |
| 80 % - 89,99 %  |   4   |
| 70 % - 79,99 %  |   3   |
| 60 % - 69,99 %  |   2   |
| 50 % - 59,99 %  |   1   |
| Less than 50 %  |   0   |

At the end of the course, there is also an exam with **pass / fail** grading. This does not affect the grade but is to ensure that you have done the exercises yourself. The exam is reserved for students of Centria University of Applied Sciences or via Open University, and at the moment official credits are only for said students. The information and the exercises are available still for anyone who wants.
